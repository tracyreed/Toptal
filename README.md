# Toptal

Although I prefer to work directly with clients/employers, I am in the Toptal
talent network. They claim to select for the top 3% in the field and I believe
they are effective in that goal.  Thus their name derived from "top talent".

To be accepted into Toptal I had to:

1. Do an interview to make sure I was a real person and a good fit
2. Take an online cybersecurity exam 
3. Do a technical interview
4. Do a cloud security design project where I was given certain specifications and document it
5. Present my project sort of like a little thesis defense where I had to explain what I did and why

In this folder you will find documents related to this project including the project documentation itself.

This was not a work for hire and is owned entirely by me, Tracy Reed.

If you would like me to do this level of work for you, get in touch.
